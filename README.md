This repository contains code related to Web-IDE, or at least my parts of it.

Recent activity focuses on the back-end evaluators, and lives in the 'evaluators'
subdirectory.  

There's also a simple web-ide server, that lives in 'plain-jane'.

## TO TRY RUNNING IT:

First, install the sxml package:

raco pkg install sxml

Then, In DrRacket, run "plain-jane/experimenting.rkt".


Also, startup will be faster if you already have a browser open before running
'experimental.rkt'.
