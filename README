This repository contains code related to Web-IDE, or at least my parts of it.

Recent activity focuses on the back-end evaluators, and lives in the 'evaluators'
subdirectory.  

There's also a simple web-ide server, that lives in 'plain-jane'.

TO TRY RUNNING IT:

In DrRacket, run "plain-jane/experimenting.rkt". It'll probably make your life easier
if you pre-install the sxml2 package by running

raco planet install clements sxml2.plt 1 0

oops I mean

racket -W info -e '(require (planet clements/sxml2))'

oh dear I should open this in an editor, rather than just using 'cat'.

Also, startup will be faster if you already have a browser open before running
'experimental.rkt'.
