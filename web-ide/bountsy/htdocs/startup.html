          <p><h3>Integers</h3></p>
          <p>
            The first step in any programming task is to think about the kinds of
            data that you need, and the first step in learning a new programming
            language is to understand the kinds of data that it can represent.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are called "values."
          </p>
          <p>
            In C, the most basic set of values are the whole numbers, or "integers."
            13 is an integer, and so is 0, and so is -146.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try entering an integer in this box:
          </p>
          <textarea id="q1box" name="comments" cols="20" rows="1"></textarea>
          <input type="submit" value="evaluate">
          <p>
            If you like, you can try a bunch of different integers. Are there
            things that you expect to be integers that aren't? If you're unsure
            about whether something is an integer in C, you can come back and use
            this box.

          <p><h3>Arithmetic operations</h3></p>
          <p>
            The C language has a variety of boolean operations, including addition (+),
            subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).  Make sure you can
            find all of these on the keyboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            These operators behave more or less as you might expect, with a few gotchas.
          </p>
          <p>
            To add <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> together, for instance, you can write <code>3 + 4</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Write an arithmetic expression that uses addition to add two numbers:
          </p>
          <textarea evaluator='any-c-addition' id="foomf" name="text-field-4"></textarea>
          <input type="submit" value="Evaluate">
          <p>
            So, what are the gotchas? The biggest one has to do with integer division.
            In C, dividing an integer by an integer produces another integer.  This works
            as you might expect for quotients like <code>4 / 2</code>, but when the denominator
            does not evenly divide the numerator, C rounds toward zero. (What if one is negative? Don't ask. Please.)
