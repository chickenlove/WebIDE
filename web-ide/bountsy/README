This directory contains a 30-line racket server that bounces requests made to
bountsy/<some-path-component> 
to
http://brinckerhoff.org:8025/<some-path-component>
... with the same post-text.  It does little to no error checking. It serves 
other URLs from the htdocs dir.

TO TRY IT OUT:

run

racket bountsy-server.rkt

... and visit the URL it prints to stdout.
